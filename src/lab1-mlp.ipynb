    "#### Robustness through Perturbations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think briefly about what we expect from a good statistical model. Obviously we want it to do well on unseen test data. One way we can accomplish this is by asking for what amounts to a 'simple' model. Simplicity can come in the form of a small number of dimensions, which is what we did when discussing fitting a function with monomial basis functions. Simplicity can also come in the form of a small norm for the basis funtions. This is what led to weight decay and $\\ell_2$ regularization. Yet a third way to impose some notion of simplicity is that the function should be robust under modest changes in the input. For instance, when we classify images, we would expect that alterations of a few pixels are mostly harmless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this notion was formalized by Bishop in 1995, when he proved that [Training with Input Noise is Equivalent to Tikhonov Regularization](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1995.7.1.108). That is, he connected the notion of having a smooth (and thus simple) function with one that is resilient to perturbations in the input. Fast forward to 2014. Given the complexity of deep networks with many layers, enforcing smoothness just on the input misses out on what is happening in subsequent layers. The ingenious idea of [Srivastava et al., 2014](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a.old/srivastava14a.pdf) was to apply Bishop's idea to the *internal* layers of the network, too, namely to inject noise into the computational path of the network while it's training.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge in this context is how to add noise without introducing undue bias. In terms of inputs $\\mathbf{x}$, this is relatively easy to accomplish: simply add some noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ to it and use this data during training via $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon$. A key property is that in expectation $\\mathbf{E}[\\mathbf{x}'] = \\mathbf{x}$. For intermediate layers, though, this might not be quite so desirable since the scale of the noise might not be appropriate. The alternative is to perturb coordinates as follows:\n",

    "h' =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    0 & \\text{ with probability } p \\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By design, the expectation remains unchanged, i.e. $\\mathbf{E}[h'] = h$. This idea is at the heart of dropout where intermediate activations $h$ are replaced by a random variable $h'$ with matching expectation. The name 'dropout' arises from the notion that some neurons 'drop out' of the computation for the purpose of computing the final result. During training we replace intermediate activations with random variables"

Let's furthermore assume that this distribution has zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$ (this doesn't mean that the distribution has to be Gaussian, just that mean and variance need to exist). We don't really have much control over the inputs into the layer $x_j$ but let's proceed with the somewhat unrealistic assumption that they also have zero mean and variance $\\gamma^2$ and that they're independent of $\\mathbf{W}$. In this case we can compute mean and variance of $h_i$ as follows:\n",

    "One way to keep the variance fixed is to set $n_\\mathrm{in} \\sigma^2 = 1$. Now consider backpropagation. There we face a similar problem, albeit with gradients being propagated from the top layers. That is, instead of $\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{w}$ we need to deal with $\\mathbf{W}^\\top \\mathbf{g}$, where $\\mathbf{g}$ is the incoming gradient from the layer above. Using the same reasoning as for forward propagation we see that the gradients' variance can blow up unless $n_\\mathrm{out} \\sigma^2 = 1$. This leaves us in a dilemma: we cannot possibly satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Instead, we simply try to satisfy\n",
